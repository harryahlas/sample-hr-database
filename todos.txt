ALL TABLES SHOULD HAVE _TABLE AND _VIEW REMOVED ON DBs

Today's blog post is a brief (2 minute read) on how to quickly upload large bunches of files to a remote server using #rstats

work on this analysis: row 173 on validations.R, almost done, separate into 1-2, 3, 4-5
# Potential analysis of 2017 reviews


# Update dates on both files
# Add data loads either separate blog entry or within page
	update "How to Install the hrsample MySQL Database" to "hrsample to a MySQL, postgres etc database"
# use dbplyr??

# validate line 196 - fix reviews - 24685 was rehired and i think it fails because it is trying to get reviews for years he was not there. review_year_list_append is error
	VALIDATE/spot check
		TMS THAT REHIRED HAVE APPROPRIATE REVIEWS/SALARIES
		not working >>TMS THAT TERMED HAVE APPROPRIATE REVIEWS/SALARIES
		TMS THAT NEVER TERMED HAVE APPROPRIATE REVIEWS/SALARIES


After all this, go over rehire piece. use find_external_hire function
	maybe say no rehires in sales jobs, or areas that have to be local
	maybe 1/40 external hires are rehires. maybe higher in technology

Switch from postgresql to postgres or whatever

# Add first contact date for rehires?  if needed

# turn validations turnover into a view? monthly turnover?

Create turnover view.  Use validations code for this.  But need to prorate the headcount based on start date during month.

run through exercises?

# Latest upcoming changes
Rehires - this is a big piece that I need to get done. There are currently no rehires and I need to fix that.
	try updating 06 and then testing on future (temp change loop date)
Bad leader/poisonous department - want to have high termination counts and poor reviews for select department/time periods.  This is also a bit of a challenge.  Still trying to figure out the best way to do it.
Bad recruiters - bad recruiters will hire employees that get bad reviews and terminate early.
Add a turnover view that shows termination rates by year or month or something similar.

Bad recruiter - in recruiting can create bad recruiters, if short tenure then likely bad recruiter
add other and Other to recruiters, and maybe a few OTHER

# sqlpet changes
COMPLETE - State in the Employeeinfo table doesn’t need to be 255 characters long. - HA: are you suggestiong to change the VARCHAR(255)?
COMPLETE - Add multiple phone numbers, mobile, home, different effective dates...all phones prior to xxx date have same effective date etc
	some work and home numbers should be the same (some built-in name collisions, like having an employee’s home phone in employeeinfo and their office phone say in deskhistory have the same name -HA: great suggestion!)
COMPLETE - Some many-to-many relationships? - HA: I could add  skills and education tables which would be many to many.  I could see them like this:
	COMPLETE -Skills: three columns: employee_num, skill_name, skill_type (skill type would be experience, certificate, course, etc...other suggestions?)
	COMPLETE -Education: three columns: employee_num, degree level (BA, BS, MA, MS, PhD etc), school_name (this would be very difficult to make realistic but I am happy to shoot for it), other suggestions?
COMPLETE - First contact date - HA: I am in the process of adding this to the recruiting table

COMPLETE - # add rollup_view
COMPLETE - # Redo exercises
COMPLETE - # change entire hierarchy spread piece?
COMPLETE - #Upload latest hrsample to github
COMPLETE - #add: "A hierarchical view called rollup_view is also available" to samplehr page
COMPLETE - Add work email addresses to contact table

#     ###NEED TO ADD CHECK HERE TO SEE IF MGR EITHER TERMINATED OR GOT A NEW JOB
    ###LOOK TO SEE IF THE MOST RECENT EMP NUM FOR THE MGR JOB HAS A MORE RECENT DESK ID
    ###IF NEITHER THEN CANNOT PROMOTE

	
	
NEXT RUN: Think about changing term rates and salaries/salary increase rate
NEXT RUN: validate that level movement makes sense.  Look at TMs that moved up a level and see if their job change is good, see if the incumbent terminated and got promoted (shouldnt happen but check)
NEXT RUN: Validate no terminations after end date of run.  Or with date 2099 etc.  If you get those then look at Create deskhistory function, 67 "  f_termination_flag <- if_else(f_temp_end_date_add < f_max_date, f_termination_flag, 0) #Similar to code above.  If job lasts until most recent date then it cannot be a termination.  So canceling termination" .  Shouldn't need this because a previous line should be taking care of it.

Update recruiting piece to account for rehires


BAD MANAGER may not be impacting turnover.  See bottom of validations.R.  Do we need to recode that? 

BAD EMPLOYEE FLAG IS NOT HAVING IMPACT ON TURNOVER, SEE IF IT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED
	fix: add bad emp flag to create_deskhistory_row function
		add multiplier for days in job, multiply by .5-.1 or something
		increase chance of turnover
IS BAD EMP FLAG IMPACTING REVIEW SCORES?

At some point communicate functions to create SQL databases	

Add specialized leader job names below.  Do this at end of 03. Look up name to job to deskid and rename that way.

LOOK AT BAD MANAGERS
REMOVE BAD TM FLAG
Remove extra employees from employeeinfo

CHECK CEO TO SEE IF HE GOT PROMOTION
WHY ARE THERE 1192 ROWS INSTEAD OF 1190? SOME DUPLICATES ACTIVE?

Future blog ideas:
	show hierarchy spread SQL

NEXT RUN FIXES:
Add state/county etc on 03 - START ON 04 ## Temp analysis - THIS IS HOW TO JOIN


add rehires
Validations on Next RUN
	look at bad employee/mgr turnover
		look to see if new hires seem to happen a lot after 90 days - if so then look at 90 day new hire fill toward beginning of loop
	Look at high turnover jobs and make sure they have higher turnover
	
Next run quick changes:	
	update all graphics after upload to git
	Look for bad managers
	

Bad manager/bad employee plug SOME OF BELOW IS COMPLETE
	Solve bad manager issue - i don't think they are having higher turnover for their TMs.
			- If job is high turnover then double the turnover chances c(2,1) * c(2,1)
	5. Increase chances of poor review
		a. on 07 add poor_review_plug = 1.  If bad_employee_flag then turn to 2.
		b. on 07, around row 188 add poor_review plug to 1 and 2 ratio.
			
	
	
Look for errors - see analysis/validations.R
	1. COMPLETE - TMs terminating then rehiring - get an idea of that.  If no rehires then we should add a few
	2. Need to add a check that TMs that left company and came back did not get a review during that period
	3. MOSTLY COMPLETE - Graph review score vs tenure
		a. COMPLETE -review in 2008 < 3 then higher chance of turnover in 2009?
		b. THINK ABOUT THIS LATER - THIS SEEMS OK BUT REVIEW AGAIN, REVIEW THIS IN analysis/validations.R turnover rate for tms with 1-2 vs 3, 4,5
		c. TENURE LOOKS GOOD FOR MINIMUM REVIEW SCORES. Tenure for b above
	4. COMPLETE - Check turnover, movement, and promotions for levels 1-3, maybe deskids 1:30 or so
		a. MOVEMENT NEEDS TO BE FIXED, ADDED TASK BELOW
		b. TURNOVER SEEMS OK
		c. PROMOTION RATES SEEM OK
	5. Only 692 active TMs?  what happened? Why empty seats?  New hires?? 
		a. NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY, WHERE THIS HAPPENS.  
			HYPOTHESIS: PEOPLE TERMINATE AND NO ONE FILLS
			HYPOTHESIS: Rowskipping is causing this on loop (i + 1)?
	6. COMPLETE - check job by states
	7. COMPLETE - Check promotions - see if people are getting promotions after a 1 or 2 review
	8. COMPLETE - Term rate is low, ~3%


Randomly add desk_ids after term.  and add new ones randomly. (if team has less than 12 tms say)
	Tough?  Think about and plan


	
Add termination types:
	Process below:
		add new process 08
		death rate: .0008
		For each term, .02 inv_term rate (set on variables) If bad employee, then multiply by 3.  If they have more than one term then they cannot be inv term
		for retirement, if TM's earliest start date(no need to worry if they rehired) is >10 years, .015 rate (set on variables)
		Else voluntary term rate .965 (set on variables)
	Voluntary Resignation: Resignation refers to a termination decided upon by an employee, who for any reason determines they want to end their employment agreement with a given organization.
		Job abandonment:Technically considered voluntary resignation, job abandonment occurs when an employee does not show up for scheduled working hours for a number of consecutive days. In most states, 3 consecutive days of unexcused absences is considered job abandonment.
	End of Temporary Employment: maybe don't worry about this...When a fixed term of temporary employment ends, the contracted temp leaves their role unless they are asked to join the organization permanently.
	Retirement: Employees retire from employment when they reach an age at which they are ready to elave the workforce permanently.
	Involuntary termination:Involuntary termination can include layoffs, closure of business, or individual termination as a result of unsatisfactory performance. (source: https://www.bambee.com/termination/)
	Add termination table at end with room for term reason 
	
COMPLETE - PENDING VALIDATION - Add movement between levels, so 4 to 3 eg...Add ability to every once in a while hire someone up a level.  There is currently no level movement (3->2 etc)
	On 06 check to see if it is a mgr position (if its desk_id is on hierarchy_table). If so then see if someone on that team has a desk id end date within 30 days.  If so then .4 chance that person gets it

Add rehires.  When picking TMs, take a look and maybe 1/30? set rehire rate globally, take that % when picking TM.  Set min 1 year since term.
	Before picking TMs, 1/30 (set variable) chance. if yes, then
	Look to see if anyone is available. 
		Determine if job is restricted by location.
			if yes then look for people who termed in that level 03 at least 1 year ago
			if no then look for same job term at least a year ago
			can also add a plug that if it has been 5 years then any job is ok to switch from

LATER:
			
Have term rates fluctuate by year
Have term rates fluctuate by LOB (maybe this fits with poor performer flag)
Clean up 06 grow desk history

update education to correlate with salary? ideas:
	use rank in colleges.csv to help with that
	only certain jobs would have phd, masters etc
			
Add job level, 1-5

Add FLSA - much later

Add overtime



Add higher turnover for higher report to number, maybe

need to add original hire date back in somewhere? maybe

add EER diagram to r package with function to print

instead of fuzzyjoin in salaryhistory try doing it in mysql to make it faster

increase turnover rate
increase turnover rate if they got a bad review? how to do that?
remove TMs that are not being used
remove poor performer flag from dataset
remove termination flag from deskhistory if date is 2999

allow position numbers and rollups to change, lobs etc

On next TM rerun:	
	Reduce number of legal TMs
		simply update this: data/departments.csv
update org structure
add operations
operations team A, B
virtual 



Nice to have: get employee numbers in order (not critical)
	
add dates.csv import instead of hard coded dates


update state distribution, more tms in CA etc

add TMs that left, have them rejoin later

build function for hierarchy spread?

see add laters on perf reviews
increase number of 2 review scores
