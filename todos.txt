For the 24th release: 
	make sure names/values match what is in post
	UPDATE DATA DISCLAIMER (AND OTHERS) TO USE HRSAMPLE PACKAGE
	send tweet...add images

At some point communicate functions to create SQL databases	
	
Next run quick changes:	
	Increase turnover rate
	
Per hw, add function that will create databases
	1. see if he responds after a few days
	2. reread, reevaluate
	3. suggestion would be to have code that automatically installs mysql, not sure if need to have just an error message or if need to install mariadb
	4. look at nosql and others

Bad manager plug 1
	FIRST need to edit create_deskhistory_row() in 01 functions.  Add an argument that can increase the termination ratio and add that in w/bad mgr, bad employee etc.
	On 07 perf reviews/salaries
	go back and somewhat randomly pick some bad lvl 4 managers.  They should have higher turnover rates. give their TMs a better chance of getting 1 or 2
	1. add poor performer flag to initial team member set.  (so if they are hired then they would have lower reviews/bad manager flag)

Improve poor performers
	in step 1 above, incorporate that poor performer flag
	
	
Look for errors - see analysis/validations.R
	1. COMPLETE - TMs terminating then rehiring - get an idea of that.  If no rehires then we should add a few
	2. Need to add a check that TMs that left company and came back did not get a review during that period
	3. MOSTLY COMPLETE - Graph review score vs tenure
		a. COMPLETE -review in 2008 < 3 then higher chance of turnover in 2009?
		b. THINK ABOUT THIS LATER - THIS SEEMS OK BUT REVIEW AGAIN, REVIEW THIS IN analysis/validations.R turnover rate for tms with 1-2 vs 3, 4,5
		c. TENURE LOOKS GOOD FOR MINIMUM REVIEW SCORES. Tenure for b above
	4. COMPLETE - Check turnover, movement, and promotions for levels 1-3, maybe deskids 1:30 or so
		a. MOVEMENT NEEDS TO BE FIXED, ADDED TASK BELOW
		b. TURNOVER SEEMS OK
		c. PROMOTION RATES SEEM OK
	5. Only 692 active TMs?  what happened? Why empty seats?  New hires?? 
		a. NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY, WHERE THIS HAPPENS.  HYPOTHESIS: PEOPLE TERMINATE AND NO ONE FILLS
	6. COMPLETE - check job by states
	7. COMPLETE - Check promotions - see if people are getting promotions after a 1 or 2 review
	8. COMPLETE - Term rate is low, ~3%

combine dates and variables scripts

Add ability to every once in a while hire someone up a level.  There is currently no level movement (3->2 etc)
Randomly add desk_ids after term.  and add new ones randomly. (if team has less than 12 tms say)
Have term rates fluctuate by year
Have term rates fluctuate by LOB (maybe this fits with poor performer flag)

Add termination types:
	Voluntary Resignation: Resignation refers to a termination decided upon by an employee, who for any reason determines they want to end their employment agreement with a given organization.
		Job abandonment:Technically considered voluntary resignation, job abandonment occurs when an employee does not show up for scheduled working hours for a number of consecutive days. In most states, 3 consecutive days of unexcused absences is considered job abandonment.
	End of Temporary Employment: maybe don't worry about this...When a fixed term of temporary employment ends, the contracted temp leaves their role unless they are asked to join the organization permanently.
	Retirement: Employees retire from employment when they reach an age at which they are ready to elave the workforce permanently.
	Involuntary termination:Involuntary termination can include layoffs, closure of business, or individual termination as a result of unsatisfactory performance. (source: https://www.bambee.com/termination/)



Add rehires.  When picking TMs, take a look and maybe 1/20? set rehire rate globally, take that % when picking TM.  Set min 1 year since term.


need to add original hire date back in somewhere? maybe

add EER diagram to r package with function to print

instead of fuzzyjoin in salaryhistory try doing it in mysql to make it faster

increase turnover rate
increase turnover rate if they got a bad review? how to do that?
remove TMs that are not being used
remove poor performer flag from dataset
remove termination flag from deskhistory if date is 2999

allow position numbers and rollups to change, lobs etc

On next TM rerun:	
	Reduce number of legal TMs
		simply update this: data/departments.csv
update org structure
add operations
operations team A, B
virtual 



Nice to have: get employee numbers in order (not critical)
	
add dates.csv import instead of hard coded dates


update state distribution, more tms in CA etc

add TMs that left, have them rejoin later

build function for hierarchy spread?

see add laters on perf reviews
increase number of 2 review scores
