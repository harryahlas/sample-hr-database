    <h1 class="article-title">Use R to add a Data Disclaimer to an Excel Report</h1>

    <span class="article-date">2019/02/16</span>
    

    <div class="article-content">
	
	<p>If you work  exclusively with clean data that can be accessed and distributed freely without fear of legal action then (1) I envy you and (2) this read is probably not for you.

	<p>I deal regularly with confidential and restricted data in a legal/regulatory environment. Data needs to be accurate and secure.  A robust disclaimer can go a long way in meeting those needs.

	<p>In this post we are going to use the openxlsx package in R to create a simple Excel human resources report and add a data disclaimer.  You can find the R script here: <a href = "xxxx">xxxx</a>.

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Ever in Our Favor</h3>

	<p>We often distribute our data in Excel format.  If you are cringing, no worries, bear with me on this. Legal and regulatory reporting is better left bland. Excel/PDF/csv etc reports are more suitable for this type of work than say, a Tableau dashboard or Shiny app. 
	
	<p>The good news is we can actually turn this archaic Excel reporting practice in our favor.  We can use Excel's ability to have multiple tabs in one workbook to create a data disclaimer.  The disclaimer will accomplish two things: 
	
	<ol class="task-list">
		<li><label>Clearly explain to our client how, if at all, s/he can distribute our data.</label></li>
		<li><label>Help the client understand the data, resulting in perceived improved accuracy.</label></li>
	</ol>

	<p>I can't emphasize enough how critical it is to proactively clarify anything that might potentially confuse the client.  The disclaimer tab is the perfect opportunity to do so. The disclaimer tab can go a long way in avoiding confusion and - as a result - save time and money down the line.  We'll see an example of this shortly. 

	<p>For this report, we'll say the legal team wants to know what the company's job headcount and turnover looked like in 2009.  Let's begin with the R script.  First things first, let's load packages, create a report name/number for tracking as well as an as of date:

	<pre class="R">
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(openxlsx)

as_of_date &#60;- Sys.Date()
report_name &#60;- "PA73405 - Attrition by Job 2009"
	</pre>

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Import Code</h3>

	<p>Next, let's get our data which I have created for an imaginary organization.  We will download "desk history" and "desk job" tables that can be used in conjunction to determine all the employees' movement information:

	<pre class="R">
deskhistory_table &#60;- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/master/data/deskhistory_table.csv")
deskjob_table &#60;- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/master/data/deskjob_table.csv")
</pre>

<p>deskhistory_table sample:
<pre class="R">
knitr::kable(deskhistory_table[sample(nrow(deskhistory_table),5),])
| employee_num| desk_id|desk_id_start_date |desk_id_end_date | termination_flag| promotion_flag|
|------------:|-------:|:------------------|:----------------|----------------:|--------------:|
|         8732|     910|1999-01-01         |2004-12-28       |                0|              0|
|        14051|     999|1999-01-01         |2003-01-19       |                0|              0|
|        45369|      35|1999-01-01         |2000-07-21       |                0|              0|
|        45958|      38|1999-01-01         |2003-04-19       |                0|              0|
|        24568|     701|1999-01-01         |2001-07-31       |                0|              0|
</pre>
<p>deskjob_table sample:
<pre class="R">
knitr::kable(deskjob_table[sample(nrow(deskjob_table),5),])
| desk_id|job_name                 |
|-------:|:------------------------|
|    1179|Product Manager          |
|    1072|Developer                |
|     451|Salesperson              |
|     510|Salesperson              |
|     330|Administrative Assistant |
</pre>
	<p>You'll notice both tables share a variable <code>desk_id</code>. You can think of it as the employee's unique desk number.  The <code>desk_id_start_date</code> and <code>desk_id_end_date</code> variables refer to the dates the employee was at that "desk".  If the employee switched to a new job somewhere else in the company they would likely switch to a new <code>desk_id</code>.  The <code>desk_id</code> is a critical key: from <code>desk_id</code> we can determine what job, location, manager, line of business, etc. belongs to the employee assigned to that <code>desk_id</code>.

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Summarize Data with Tidyverse</h3>

	<p>Now that we have the raw data, let's use some standard dplyr/tidyr functions to join the two datasets and create a simple data frame that summarizes turnover and headcount by job.  

	<pre class="r">
hcto_summary &#60;- deskhistory_table %>% 
  left_join(deskjob_table) %>% 
  filter(desk_id_start_date &#60;= as.Date("2009-12-31"),
         desk_id_end_date &#60;= as.Date("2009-01-01")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(desk_id_end_date)) %>% 
  group_by(employee_num) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2009",
         termination_flag = if_else(termination_flag == 1, "Terminated", "DidNotTerminate")) %>% 
  count(job_name, termination_flag) %>% 
  spread(termination_flag, n, fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(Headcount =  Terminated + DidNotTerminate,
         TerminationRate = percent(Terminated / Headcount)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Terminated / Headcount))
</pre>

	<p>We are not going to focus much on this code, though I do want to call out one piece. We have to account for the fact that some employees would have switched jobs in 2009 and have multiple entries during that year. This is something we will want to call out on our disclaimer tab in order to avoid confusion down the line. 
	
	<p>We only want to count each employee one time so we will count their most recent information for that year. We can sort the data with the  most recent <code>desk_id_end_date</code> and then <code>group_by(employee_num) %>% filter(row_number() == 1)</code> in order to select the most recent of those jobs.  Nifty trick I use a lot, and we will be sure to document it in the disclaimer.

	<p>Here is the output data that we want to send to the clients:

	<pre class="r">
knitr::kable(hcto_summary)
|year |job_name                 | DidNotTerminate| Terminated| Headcount|TerminationRate |

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Data Disclaimer Tab</h3>

<p>With that behind us, the data is almost ready to export. We are now at the data disclaimer piece. Before continuing, I need to mention this disclaimer is very basic and for demonstration purposes only.   <b>Always consult your legal team for approval of the final verbiage</b>.

<p>This disclaimer will include distribution information as well as information about how the data was pulled.  This is our shot to clarify the way we are counting employees (only count the most recent 2009 job). The client typically doesn't have time to think about these types of details, so making this clarification now will prepare your client for questions and potentially save you from a urgent follow up scrambles that no one enjoys.


Here is this example's verbiage:

<pre class="r">
disclaimer_info &#60;- data.frame(Information = 
  c("Source: https://github.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/tree/master/data",
    paste("Data as of", as_of_date, "."),
    "Data includes all employees rolling up to CEO Tricia Avallone who were active at any point from Jan 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009.",
    "If the employee had multiple jobs during 2009, only the most recent job is counted.",
    "Data is confidential and should be shared on a need to know basis only.",
    "Do not distribute externally.")) 
</pre>

	<p>Note that the text is enclosed in a concatenation <code> c("xxx", "yyy", "zzz")</code>.  The openxlsx package will look for the commas between quoted words and determine that words that come after the commas go into a new row in Excel.

	<p>In some instances you may want to include a link to the source or your R script.  In this case we have the request number included in the name of the file, which is enough.

	
	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Export to Excel</h3>

	<p>I tend to favor the openxlsx package over others for exporting to Excel.  It seems less error prone because it is not dependent on Java.  With that, let's start by creating a new Excel workbook object <code>wb</code> and adding two tabs: the first for the data summary and the second for the disclaimer.

<pre class="r">
wb &#60;- createWorkbook()
addWorksheet(wb, report_name)
addWorksheet(wb, "Data Disclaimer")
</pre>

	<p>Now we can write our summary and disclaimer data frames to each sheet.  The numbers 1 and 2 below are the sheet numbers.

	<pre class="r">
writeDataTable(wb, 1, hcto_summary)
writeDataTable(wb, 2, disclaimer_info)
</pre>

	<p>Last, we'll save the workbook with the report name and date and we are done!

	<pre class="r">
saveWorkbook(wb, paste0(report_name, as_of_date, ".xlsx"), TRUE)
</pre>

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Final Thought - Why Automate?</h3>
	
	<p>For a one time report it may seem like a lot of work to add one tab with only 7 rows of text.  Why not just input the text directly into Excel?
	
	<p>I would agree this is overkill for one report.  However, there is probably a good chance that this code can be reused later.  It could be packaged into a function as well, depending on your need.
	
	<p>The value really rears its head when you start producing multiple reports - super handy!  That is something I will be tackling on a future post and look forward to sharing with you.  
	
	<p>Thanks for reading - I would appreciate any feedback.  <a href = "xxx">Here</a> is a link to the code.
